import React, { useState } from "react";

export default Counter;

//  If you pass a value directly, such as setCounter(counter + 1),
//  React's ability to keep track of condition conditions can be detected in these differences.
//   However, in accordance with its function,
//   it ensures that every update step of React is followed accurately.
